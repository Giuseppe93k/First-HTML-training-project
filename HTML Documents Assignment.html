			Welcome to my first HTML Project/Assignment.
			The subject I choose is about F1 since I am an F1 maniac.

				<h3>The team I support is Ferrari</h3>
					<p>I ha linked the ferrari official website here:
						<a href="https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/formula1"> Scuderia Ferrari</a>
					</p>
				<P>I am Italian so it is normal for me to be a fan of Ferrari.
					My favourate driver is Charles Lecrerc and the reason i like him its because he knows what it is like to be a ferrari fan.
					He said:</p>
				<blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/charles_leclerc_1127285">"THE RED CAR, EVEN BEFORE I KNEW IT WAS CALLED FERRARI, WAS MY OBSESSION."</blockquote>
				<p>Here is a video of his best overtakes</p>
